# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
BootCamp Week7 SQL 

# Overview 
  Pewlett- Hackard is a large company with a long time in the industry, so it has a lot of employees in retirement age. For this reason, they are preparing  two strategies: first, offering a retirement package for the next to retire employees,  and second, preparing other employees to ocupy the future vacancies.  
From the previous work,  we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, because this is the number of future vacancies and they need to prepare people for this. Then we need to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.



# Results
  Based on the information provided by the company, we began the analysis by building the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) to build new tables through queries that would give us the information we were looking for. We generate different queries to  get 2 principal tables: one, *Unique Titles* with the data of  the actual employees in age of retirement and their actual titles, to know how many vacancies will in the next months, and the second *Retiring Titles* with the count of the employees and their titles.

  From this results, it can see that the company will have **72,458 vacancies** in the next future. This requires a deep planning and reorganization of the jobs in order to hire new elements for the most basic levels and at the same time to promote the growth of the talents that are already in the company. To do this, the company is proposing a mentoring plan so that employees with some experience can start preparing new talent for their future positions. The next table shows the candidates to the new Mentorship program. 

**Mentorship titles**

From this table we can see that the number of candidates to be mentored is not enough to prepare the large number of positions that will need to be filled.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
